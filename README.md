Tetris Game
I created a simple Tetris game using Python and Pygame as my second project for the Athena Awards. This project helped me learn the basics of game development,
including how to handle movement, collision detection, and scoring. The game features classic Tetris gameplay where blocks fall and can be moved by the player. 
Lines clear when they are completely filled, and the game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen. The playerâ€™s score increases with each cleared line.
I took 8hours 38mins in this project.
